/**
 * AnnouncementCoordinator — proactive-chat one-time activation announcement
 * (PRD #2291, slice #2300).
 *
 * The very first time a workspace admin flips `proactive.enabled = true`
 * AND has set an `announcement_channel_id`, Atlas posts a single
 * onboarding message to that channel so end-users learn about the new
 * behaviour before the bot starts reacting to their messages.
 *
 * Idempotency contract:
 *   - `workspace_proactive_config.announcement_posted_at` (NULL = never
 *     posted) is the single source of truth.
 *   - A successful post stamps the column inside the same transaction
 *     so concurrent admins flipping the toggle race-safely produce one
 *     announcement, not N.
 *   - Disabling + re-enabling does NOT clear the stamp — re-announcing
 *     every toggle would erode end-user trust ("did this just install
 *     again?").
 *
 * Port shape: the coordinator depends on a `ChatAnnouncer` interface
 * rather than the chat plugin directly so:
 *   - The host can wire any chat-platform implementation (Slack today,
 *     Teams / Discord / etc tomorrow) without dragging the coordinator
 *     into the plugin closure.
 *   - Unit tests can pass an in-memory stub instead of standing up the
 *     full chat-plugin bridge.
 *
 * Failure policy: posting is best-effort. If the announcer rejects, the
 * coordinator returns `{ posted: false, reason }` and leaves the DB
 * stamp NULL so a later retry (next admin save, scheduled retry, etc)
 * can re-attempt. The route layer treats the announcement as a
 * non-blocking side-effect of the PUT — failing to announce never fails
 * the API call.

/**
 * Post the activation announcement if (and only if) it has never been
 * posted for this workspace.
 *
 * Race safety: the stamp is **claimed atomically BEFORE the post**.
 * Concurrent admin enable flips race on a single conditional UPDATE
 * (`SET announcement_posted_at = NOW() WHERE announcement_posted_at
 * IS NULL`); Postgres serialises the writes and exactly one UPDATE
 * affects a row. The winner proceeds to post the announcement; the
 * losers see `rowCount = 0` and return `already_posted` without
 * calling the announcer. This guarantees at-most-one post per
 * workspace under any concurrency, at the cost of: if the announcer
 * call fails after the stamp is taken, we treat the announcement as
 * delivered (no retry). That trade is correct here — `chat.post` is
 * the cheap side and double-announcing erodes end-user trust more
 * than silently dropping a single failed post; admins can re-trigger
 * via a follow-up "Resend announcement" affordance if needed.
