/**
 * MCP-prompts wire-format schemas — single source of truth for the
 * `/api/v1/me/mcp-prompts` response shape, used by the listing pipeline,
 * the route layer, and the web client.
 *
 * The Zod schemas are authoritative; TS shapes are `z.infer<>` of the
 * schemas, so a new `CanonicalGateReason` / `PromptSource` / `CanonicalToggle`
 * value is a one-place change and drift surfaces as a TS error in every
 * consumer.
 *
 * Why these schemas live in `@useatlas/schemas` and not in `@atlas/mcp`:
 * the mcp package depends on `@atlas/api`, so a Zod entry point exported
 * from there would transitively pull `@atlas/api` into any web caller —
 * a violation of the "frontend never imports from `@atlas/api`" rule
 * documented in CLAUDE.md. `@useatlas/schemas` sits below `@atlas/*` (an
 * oxlint `no-restricted-imports` rule scoped to `packages/schemas/**`
 * fails the lint on an upward import) so the dependency direction stays
 * `types → schemas → api/web/mcp`.

 *
 * Two non-obvious choices to flag:

 *     infers the TS type as `[]` (empty tuple); `.max(0)` keeps
 *     `PromptArgumentSpec[]` and would let `arguments: [{...}]`
 *     type-check while only failing at runtime — defeating the lift.
 *   - Two arms (one literal `"builtin"`, one `z.enum([...derived])`)
 *     instead of four single-literal arms. Three sources share an
 *     identical structural shape (no caller-supplied parameters), so
 *     collapsing avoids quadruplicating `name` / `description`. The
 *     `_SourcesCovered` witness below pins the second arm's enum
 *     against `PROMPT_SOURCES` so a 5th source fails type-check, not
 *     runtime parse.
