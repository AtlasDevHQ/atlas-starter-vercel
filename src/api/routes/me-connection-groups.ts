/**
 * `GET /api/v1/me/connection-groups` — non-admin listing of the user's
 * accessible connection groups and their members. Powers the chat
 * env/member picker (#2345).
 *
 * Authorization: any authenticated user with an active organization.
 * The response is scoped to `orgId` so callers only see groups in
 * their own workspace.
 *
 * Distinct from `/api/v1/admin/connection-groups` (admin-only):
 *   - That endpoint exposes mutation routes (POST / PATCH / DELETE).
 *   - This endpoint is read-only and serves end-user surfaces (chat
 *     header picker, conversation create dialog). It cannot grow new
 *     verbs — non-admin users must not be able to mutate group state.
 *
 * `reason` distinguishes "empty because the workspace genuinely has no
 * groups" (null — picker stays hidden, chat falls back to the legacy
 * single-connection path) from "empty because the request can't reach a
 * usable state" (`no_internal_db` / `no_active_org` — picker renders
 * explanatory copy instead of silently disappearing). See #2422.
