/**
 * Generic credential store backing the `integration_credentials` table
 * (#2658). Lazy OAuth integrations (Salesforce ships first; future
 * Jira / etc. ride on the same table) persist refresh-token bundles
 * here rather than embedding them in `workspace_plugins.config` JSONB.
 *
 * Why a sibling table instead of the JSONB pattern used by form-based
 * installs (#2697 — Email):
 *
 *   1. OAuth refresh tokens have an independent lifecycle (rotation on
 *      access-token expiry, "reconnect needed" surface on refresh
 *      failure). A dedicated table lets the rotation write isolate to
 *      one row + bump `updated_at` without touching the install record.
 *   2. The credential lookup is on the hot agent tool-call path. A
 *      dedicated index (`idx_integration_credentials_unique`) is
 *      cheaper than reaching into `workspace_plugins.config` JSONB.
 *   3. ADR-0003's two-store teardown order ("credentials FIRST, install
 *      record SECOND") becomes a clean DELETE in this table followed by
 *      a DELETE in `workspace_plugins` — no JSONB editing in place.
 *
 * Encryption: the full credentials object (access_token, refresh_token,
 * expires_at, instance_url, scope, token_type) is JSON-stringified then
 * encrypted via `encryptSecret` from `db/secret-encryption.ts`. Per
 * CLAUDE.md "new integration credential columns SHOULD default to
 * `db/secret-encryption.ts`" — this is *not* a URL column and doesn't
 * match any of the legacy `db/internal.ts` call sites.
 *
 * @see ADR-0003 two-store chat install metadata + credentials
 * @see packages/api/src/lib/db/migrations/0089_integration_credentials.sql

/**
 * Decrypted credential bundle. The same shape is used for every OAuth
 * integration that writes here — additional per-Platform fields land
 * in a string-keyed extension map (`extra`) so the bundle stays generic
 * without sacrificing typed access to the common OAuth surface.
 *
 * - `accessToken` / `refreshToken` — the bearer pair the platform
 *   returns on the token exchange.
 * - `expiresAt` — milliseconds since epoch. Used by the rotation flow
 *   to decide whether the access token is still good. `null` when the
 *   platform doesn't return an `expires_in` (treated as "non-expiring"
 *   — refresh only on 401).
 * - `tokenType` — usually "Bearer" but preserved verbatim in case a
 *   future platform returns something else.
 * - `scope` — space-separated scope list from the token response.
 *   Useful for the admin UI's "this install has access to …" surface.
 * - `instanceUrl` — Salesforce-specific must-have (per-tenant API
 *   hostname like `https://na139.salesforce.com`). Generic-typed here
 *   because the store stays generic across platforms; consumers cast
 *   it on read. Empty string when the platform doesn't surface one.
 * - `extra` — per-platform extension map. Stored as part of the
 *   encrypted blob so a Salesforce-only field (e.g. `id_token`) lives
 *   alongside the rest of the bundle without a schema change.
