/**
 * `WorkspaceInstallGate` — Atlas issue #2655 (1.5.2 slice 7).
 *
 * Per-event "is this workspace's install of <catalog entry> active?"
 * predicate. Wired into the proactive listener as the outermost check
 * for every channel-message event so absent-or-disabled installs
 * silent-skip BEFORE classify (no LLM call, no meter row, no
 * rate-limit hit, no DB write further down the pipeline).
 *
 * Returns `true` ONLY when all four facts hold:
 *
 *   1. A `workspace_plugins` row exists for `(workspaceId, catalogId)`,
 *   2. that row's `enabled = true`,
 *   3. the joined `plugin_catalog` row's `enabled = true`,
 *   4. the workspace's `organization.plan_tier` ranks ≥ the catalog
 *      row's `min_plan`.
 *
 * Any other state (missing install row, install disabled, catalog
 * disabled, plan mismatch, DB hiccup) returns `false`. Fails closed so
 * a registry outage silences the proactive flow rather than letting
 * an unverified workspace continue.
 *
 * ## Plan-tier ranking
 *
 * The two enums historically drifted (catalog's `min_plan` enum vs
 * organization's `plan_tier`):
 *
 *   - `plugin_catalog.min_plan ∈ { starter, team, business, enterprise }`
 *   - `organization.plan_tier  ∈ { free, trial, starter, pro, business }`
 *
 * `PLAN_RANK` below assigns each known value a numeric rank so the
 * comparison is well-defined across both enums. Unknown plan_tier
 * values rank 0 (most restrictive — when we can't classify the
 * workspace, default to "below all gates"). Unknown min_plan values
 * fail closed by *not* admitting the row — a typo in a catalog seed
 * shouldn't accidentally widen access.
 *
 * ## Per-event caching
 *
 * `createInstallGateCache()` returns a wrapper that memoises results
 * by `(workspaceId, catalogId)` for the lifetime of one event handler
 * invocation. Mirrors the per-event-fetch pattern in
 * `plugins/chat/src/proactive/listener.ts`; the listener constructs a
 * fresh cache at the top of each event so a 'gate said no' result
 * doesn't leak across events (the install could be re-enabled between
 * one Slack event and the next).
 *
 * The cache is intentionally NOT shared across events: a per-process
 * cache with a TTL would mean an admin's "uninstall" UI click took
 * up-to-TTL seconds to take effect, which loses the contract the gate
 * was meant to provide.
 *
 * ## Deep-module note
 *
 * This module is the deep module (architecture-tagged). The interface
 * — `isWorkspaceInstallActive(workspaceId, catalogId): Promise<boolean>`
 * — is one boolean; the implementation absorbs JOIN, encryption-free
 * read of plan tier, enum ranking, and fail-closed error handling.
 * Banked in `.claude/research/architecture-wins.md`.
 *
