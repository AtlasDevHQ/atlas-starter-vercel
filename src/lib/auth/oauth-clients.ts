/**
 * Shared OAuth-client query + revoke helpers (#2065).
 *
 * 1.4.0's admin OAuth-clients page (#2024 / #2062) and 1.4.1's per-user
 * `/settings/ai-agents` surface (#2065) both list and revoke the same
 * Better-Auth `oauthClient` rows — they only differ in scope:
 *
 *   - Admin sees every client registered in the workspace
 *     (`referenceId = orgId`).
 *   - A workspace user sees only the clients they personally registered
 *     (`userId = self AND referenceId = orgId`).
 *
 * Revocation atomicity (the four ordered DELETEs inside one transaction
 * with race + rollback handling) is identical between the two callers.
 * Forking the SQL between two route files would mean any future schema
 * change (FK direction, ON DELETE policy, new outstanding-token table) has
 * to land in two places. This module is the single source.
 *
 * Pure helpers — no Effect, no audit, no HTTP. Callers wrap with their own
 * `Effect.promise(...)`, audit emission, and runHandler bridging. The
 * helper returns a discriminated `RevokeOutcome` so the route can branch on
 * success / race / rolled-back without exception handling, and emit the
 * phase-aware audit metadata that the F-29 forensic queries already pivot
 * on.

/**
 * Token-state classification surfaced to the per-user UI (#2066).
 *
 * - `active`              — the client is enabled and has at least one
 *                           outstanding non-expired access OR refresh
 *                           token. The agent should be able to make a
 *                           tools/call without user-visible re-auth.
 * - `reconnect_required`  — the client is enabled but every access
 *                           token has expired *and* no usable refresh
 *                           token remains (refresh exhausted or never
 *                           issued). The UI surfaces a re-run-wizard CTA.
 * - `revoked`             — the client row is `disabled = true`.
 *                           **As of v1.4.1, no production code path
 *                           produces this state**: `revokeOAuthClient`
 *                           performs a hard `DELETE FROM "oauthClient"`,
 *                           so a revoked client disappears from the
 *                           list query entirely. The state is reserved
 *                           for a future soft-revoke flow that flips
 *                           `disabled` without removing the row (so the
 *                           audit trail stays intact under whole-row
 *                           retention policy). The UI rendering and
 *                           tests exist now to keep the contract
 *                           pinned for that future flow.
 *
 * The `disabled` flag is authoritative for `revoked` regardless of
 * outstanding token counts — when the soft-revoke flow lands, tokens
 * may not yet be cascaded by the time the list query reads, and the
 * UI must already say "Revoked" rather than "Active."
