/**
 * Symmetric encryption for arbitrary secret payloads (F-41).
 *
 * **WARNING — name collision with `db/internal.ts`.** Both modules
 * export `encryptSecret` / `decryptSecret` post-#2285 with identical
 * `(string) => string` signatures and divergent runtime semantics. An
 * IDE auto-import will silently bind to whichever it picks first; the
 * `db/internal.ts` pair has URL-scheme plaintext passthrough on read
 * (a `https://…` opaque secret would be returned unchanged), the pair
 * here has only `enc:v<N>:` prefix gating. **Always pick by the
 * column's payload type, not by the auto-import suggestion.**
 *
 * Picking guide:
 *   • New integration credential column / opaque secret blob → use
 *     this module (`db/secret-encryption.ts`).
 *   • URL column, or a column matching one of the two surviving legacy
 *     `db/internal.ts` call sites (`workspace_model_config.api_key_encrypted`,
 *     `sso_providers.config.clientSecret`) → use `db/internal.ts`.
 *     The third historical call site (`connections.url`) was dropped in
 *     migration 0096 / #2744 per ADR-0007.
 *
 * Why two helpers exist: `db/internal.ts`'s `decryptSecret` gates
 * plaintext detection on a URL-scheme regex (`^<scheme>://`) plus a
 * 3-colon-count check. Neither works for integration credentials —
 * Telegram bot tokens like `1234:abc…` aren't URLs and don't split
 * into three parts (the plaintext would be rejected on read), and JSON
 * blobs can coincidentally produce three colon-separated parts
 * (triggering a spurious decrypt attempt). The versioned `enc:v1:`
 * prefix used here sidesteps both problems and leaves room for
 * `enc:v2:` once key rotation lands (F-47 / #1820).
 *
 * Kept in a dedicated module so tests that partially-mock `db/internal`
 * (common in admin route tests) aren't forced to declare extra no-op
 * exports to avoid `SyntaxError: Export not found`. Mock
 * `db/secret-encryption` separately when a test needs it.
