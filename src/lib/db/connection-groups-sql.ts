 * the root cause of #2410 going unnoticed under the #2406 patch.
 *

 * MUST match `status = 'archived'` unconditionally — both archived shapes
 * (real org-owned archived rows AND `url = ''` per-org global-hide

/**
 * Atomic merge SQL: consolidate N source connections into one target
 * environment within a single statement (#2409). A single CTE-driven
 * statement is the atomicity primitive — Postgres evaluates every branch
 * inside one implicit transaction, so a failure in any branch rolls every
 * branch back. Avoids needing `pool.connect()` + manual BEGIN/COMMIT
 * (which the route mock surface doesn't currently expose).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   $1 = target group id (newly generated; only consumed when the
 *        ON CONFLICT branch does NOT fire and we actually insert)
 *   $2 = org id
 *   $3 = target group display name (trimmed, validated via GROUP_NAME_PATTERN)
 *   $4 = primary_connection_id to seed on INSERT (always one of the source ids)
 *   $5 = boolean — when true, the override REPLACES the existing primary on
 *        ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE; when false, the existing primary is preserved
 *   $6 = source connection ids (text[])
 *   $7 = source group ids — the union of group_ids the source connections
 *        were sitting in before the merge.
 *
 * Cleanup gating (the `cleanup` CTE) deletes a candidate source group iff:
 *   1. `id LIKE 'g\_%' ESCAPE '\' AND name = SUBSTRING(id FROM 3)` →
 *      only auto-backfilled singletons (migration 0062 shape) are
 *      eligible. User-renamed groups and `g_<random>` user-created
 *      groups are preserved even when empty.
 *   2. `id <> target.id` → never delete the target we just landed in.
 *   3. `NOT EXISTS` guards against every reference table that carries a
 *      `connection_group_id` column today. The FK-bearing references
 *      (`connections.group_id`, `approval_queue.connection_group_id`,
 *      `scheduled_tasks.connection_group_id`) would raise 23503 and roll
 *      the merge back without the guard; the soft-reference columns
 *      (`dashboard_cards.connection_group_id`,
 *      `semantic_entities.connection_group_id`,
 *      `pii_column_classifications.connection_group_id`,
 *      `conversations.connection_group_id`) carry no FK (see 0066
 *      "Why no FK on connection_group_id") and would silently dangle —
 *      worse than a rolled-back merge, because downstream readers would
 *      stop matching the orphaned rows. Guarding both FK and soft
 *      references collapses the two failure modes to one: a source
 *      group with admin-curated content is left in place, the merge
 *      succeeds with a partial cleanup, and the residual group surfaces
 *      in `skipped_group_ids` so the wizard can show what was preserved.
 *
 *   The connections NOT EXISTS guard subtracts the `$6::text[]` source
 *   set explicitly — Postgres data-modifying CTEs share one snapshot, so
 *   the sibling `moved` UPDATE is invisible to a fresh SELECT on
 *   `connections` here. Without the `<> ALL($6)` subtraction, the
 *   cleanup would see every source connection still in its source group
 *   and skip every candidate, leaving `deleted_group_ids` empty in
 *   production while the wire tests (which mock the CTE result directly)
 *   would still pass. The bug is invisible without a real-Postgres
 *   smoke; see #2437 codex review for the diagnosis.
 *
 *   `dashboard_cards` is the lone reference without its own `org_id`
 *   (see migration 0066 § "Why no FK on connection_group_id" — cards
 *   inherit org scope from their parent `dashboards` row). The
 *   composite (id, org_id) PK on connection_groups means a `cg.id`
 *   can repeat across orgs, so the dashboard_cards predicate alone
 *   could incorrectly preserve a group when the dangling card is in
 *   a different org. We accept this conservatively: any global-`cg.id`
 *   collision (rare and observable via audit) is preferable to silently
 *   orphaning a card.
 *
 * Return shape: one row, four columns.
 *   target               jsonb  — { id, name, primaryConnectionId, createdAt, updatedAt, created }
 *   moved_connection_ids text[] — ids actually re-parented this statement
 *   deleted_group_ids    text[] — auto-backfilled source groups cleaned up
 *   skipped_group_ids    text[] — auto-backfilled candidates we declined
 *                                 to delete because a NOT EXISTS guard
 *                                 fired (i.e. the group still anchors
 *                                 admin-curated content). Surfaced so
 *                                 the wizard preview can reconcile its
 *                                 client-side cleanup estimate with the
 *                                 server's actual decision.
 *
 * The `(xmax = 0)` trick on the target CTE tells INSERT (no concurrent
 * xact touched the row) from ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE (the conflicting row
 * was visible). Wire-format calls this `created` so the wizard knows
 * whether to say "Created prod" vs "Added to prod".
