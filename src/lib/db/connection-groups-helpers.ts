/**
 * True iff `name` would collide with an existing connection id in this org.
 * Centralised so every group-name entry surface refuses the same shape;
 * see the call-site enumeration in the test file
 * (`admin-connection-groups-name-collision.test.ts`) for the canonical
 * coverage matrix, including the merge-route reuse carve-out and the
 * POST `/admin/connections` self-name carve-out.
 *
 * Rationale (#2506): the 0062 1:1 backfill creates groups shaped
 * `id = 'g_' || conn.id`, `name = conn.id`. Two production paths
 * (documented in migration 0072) can leave one of those rows behind
 * with zero members, surfacing in the env combobox as a ghost
 * environment whose label collides with a real connection id. A
 * user-initiated create that lands the same literal collision would
 * re-introduce the same confusion at no benefit — the schema-vs-display
 * vocabulary divide ("connection group" ↔ "environment") means an admin
 * is not consciously typing a connection id into the env name field;
 * matches are typo-grade.
 *
 * Scope is intentionally narrow:
 *   - Only refuses LITERAL equality with an existing connection id.
 *     A group named "Production" with members `us-prod` / `eu-prod` is
 *     fine — the name does not match any connection id.
 *   - Org-scoped via `connections.org_id`. The composite-PK shape
 *     `(id, org_id)` means a SaaS tenant can share an id like `default`
 *     with another tenant; this check only sees the caller's own
 *     connections.
 *   - Does NOT touch existing rows. Pre-fix groups that already collide
 *     (i.e. the orphan this guard exists to prevent) are cleaned up by
 *     migration 0072. Retroactively renaming or refusing them would
 *     break legitimate single-region setups where the admin has
 *     deliberately given a connection-named group a meaningful display
 *     label.
 *
 * Error-propagation contract: callers MUST run inside `runHandler` (or
 * an equivalent Effect → HTTP bridge). The helper deliberately does NOT
 * try/catch a thrown `internalQuery` rejection — a local `catch { return
 * false }` would silently fail-open, bypassing the guard on any DB
 * blip. Letting the throw bubble produces a 500 with `requestId` and a
 * structured log line, which is the right answer for a soft security
 * check (CLAUDE.md "Prefer errors over silent fallbacks"). The
 * fail-closed contract is pinned by a dedicated test in
 * `admin-connection-groups-name-collision.test.ts`.
 *
 * Returns true when a collision exists. Callers map true → 409 with a
 * friendly message; false → continue.
