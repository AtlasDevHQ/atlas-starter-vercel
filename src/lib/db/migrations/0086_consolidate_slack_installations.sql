-- Atlas issue #2634 — drop the dual-store dependency between the
-- legacy `slack_installations` Postgres table and the chat plugin's
-- `chat_cache` table that already holds Slack workspace installs for
-- the @chat-adapter/slack multi-workspace lookup path.
--
-- Pre-#2634 OAuth installs wrote to `slack_installations` (with Atlas's
-- versioned secret-encryption), but the chat plugin's listener resolved
-- per-event bot tokens from `chat_cache:slack:installation:<teamId>`.
-- The two stores drifted on every install; an internal back-fill
-- script would have been needed (or actually was needed pre-merge,
-- per the issue body — see #2634) to keep them in sync. With this
-- migration consolidation removes the need for any such bandage:
-- Atlas writes straight to `chat_cache` from the OAuth callback, the
-- chat-adapter reads the same rows, and `slack_installations` is
-- dropped.
--
-- The org_id index is preserved as a **partial expression index** on
-- `chat_cache.value->>'orgId'`, filtered by the `slack:installation:`
-- key prefix. This is lighter-weight than a JSONB GIN (only the orgId
-- field is queried) and cheaper than a sidecar table (no atomic
-- two-write semantics to maintain).
--
-- This migration takes ownership of `chat_cache` (and its companion
-- expiry index) from the chat plugin's lazy `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
-- EXISTS` in `plugins/chat/src/state/pg-adapter.ts`. The plugin's
-- runtime-side creation stays in place as a safety net (idempotent),
-- but migrations are now the authoritative schema source — required
-- to (a) layer an index on top here and (b) include the table in the
-- real-PG migrate smoke test (`migrate-pg.test.ts`).
--
-- **Breaking change.** Existing `slack_installations` rows are NOT
-- copied — they were encrypted with Atlas's versioned secret-encryption
-- format which is binary-incompatible with the chat-adapter's AES-GCM
-- envelope. The chat-adapter cannot decrypt them. Operators with
-- existing installs must reinstall the Slack app once. Pre-1.0
-- semver — one-click reinstall is acceptable. The 1.5.0 dogfood
-- (#sandbox-atlas) workspace is the only known existing tenant; it
-- will be reinstalled as part of this PR's verification.
--
-- **Historical `@useatlas/slack` plugin notice.** That plugin (replaced
-- by `@useatlas/chat`) used to read/write `slack_installations` directly
-- via `plugins/slack/src/store.ts`. It was retired from the monorepo in
-- #2683; the npm-published `@useatlas/slack@0.0.5` remains in the
-- registry but is unmaintained. The `@useatlas/chat` adapter is the
-- single active path for Slack installs going forward.
