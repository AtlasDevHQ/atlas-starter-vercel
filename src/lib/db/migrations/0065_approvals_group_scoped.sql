-- 0065 — Group-scoped approval queue (PRD #2336, issue #2344).
--
-- Adds `approval_queue.connection_group_id` and drops the vestigial
-- `connection_id NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default'` so the row keys on the
-- environment group rather than the originating connection. The HITL
-- assumption baked into the PRD: one approval covers any group member
-- running the same query. Keying on connection forced re-approval per
-- replica even when an admin had already greenlit the query for the
-- group — the exact dogfood pain #2336 set out to remove.
--
-- `connection_id` stays on the table for the transitional window so
-- audit reviewers can see which member originated the request. The
-- NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default' goes away: legacy callers that didn't
-- stamp a real connection_id were silently rewritten to the string
-- 'default' on insert, which is itself drift the audit log should not
-- carry post-#2344. Nullable from here; the column gets removed in a
-- follow-up slice once the SDK consumers settle.
--
-- Migration sequencing: #2344 owns 0065. #2340 (semantic) shipped at
-- 0063; #2343 (PII) lands at 0064; #2342 (dashboards) at 0066. All
-- four slices share the same recipe: nullable FK to connection_groups,
-- backfill via the 0062 1:1 map, no NOT NULL flip in this PR.

-- ── 1. Column ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Nullable initially. Legacy rows pre-#2344 carry `connection_group_id
-- IS NULL` until the backfill below resolves them. Runtime lookups only
-- share approvals across non-NULL groups; ungrouped connections fall back
-- to `connection_id` scope so unrelated NULL-group connections do not
-- authorize each other.
ALTER TABLE approval_queue
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS connection_group_id TEXT;

-- Global/demo connections live in the sentinel `__global__` org, but
-- approval_queue rows are tenant-scoped. Before we enforce the composite
-- FK below, mirror any global connection's group row into each tenant
-- that already has approval rows for that global connection. The approval
-- row stores the same group id with the tenant org_id, so the FK remains
-- tenant-local while demo / built-in connections still resolve through the
-- same visibility rule used by the runtime.

-- RESTRICT: dropping a group with live approval rows pointing at it must
-- fail loudly — admins are expected to expire or reject the queue before
-- tearing down the group. The route-layer DELETE handler in
-- `admin-connection-groups.ts` already checks for members; this FK is the
-- last-resort defence if a caller bypasses it.

-- 'default' if one exists for the org; otherwise it stays NULL and the
-- lookup falls through to the legacy "no group" path. Same join
-- predicate as 0063 so demo / `__global__` rows resolve via the same
-- visibility rule the whitelist already uses.
--
-- Idempotent: the predicate `connection_group_id IS NULL` ensures
-- re-runs leave already-resolved rows alone.

-- ── 3. Drop legacy NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default' on connection_id ────────
--
-- The vestigial guard from the pre-#2344 era — every insert that didn't
-- carry a connection_id got rewritten to the string 'default', which
-- then drifted into the audit log as if a connection actually named
-- 'default' was the source. Now that the lookup keys on group, the
-- column can carry the originating connection_id verbatim (including
-- NULL for callers that genuinely have no member context yet).
--
-- The DROP NOT NULL is wrapped to be re-runnable: a second migration
-- pass against an already-migrated schema is a no-op rather than an
-- error.
