-- 0068 — Group-scoped scheduled tasks (PRD #2336, issue #2343).
--
-- Scheduled tasks now belong to a connection group (UI: environment)
-- rather than a single physical connection. The legacy connection_id column
-- remains as an execution/audit compatibility field until the #2346 cleanup.
--
-- Runtime execution remains one task dispatch per cron tick. At fire time the
-- scheduler resolves connection_group_id to the group's primary member, or to
-- the first member by (created_at, id) when no usable primary exists.
