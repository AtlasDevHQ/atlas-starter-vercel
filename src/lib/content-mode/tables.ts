/**
 * Registration tuple for mode-participating content tables (#1515).
 *
 * Adding a new simple content table is a one-line change at the end of
 * this tuple: `{ kind: "simple", key: "dashboards" }` is enough — the
 * physical table name, default UPDATE SQL, and default COUNT SQL are
 * derived from the key, and the `ModeDraftCounts` wire type updates
 * itself via `InferDraftCounts`.
 *
 * Order matters: `runPublishPhases` invokes adapters in tuple order
 * inside the caller's transaction. Tables with foreign-key dependencies
 * on later entries must be declared earlier.
 *
 * The `semantic_entities` entry is exotic — its promote path composes
 * `applyTombstones` + `promoteDraftEntities` from
 * `lib/semantic/entities.ts`. See `./adapters/semantic-entities.ts`.
