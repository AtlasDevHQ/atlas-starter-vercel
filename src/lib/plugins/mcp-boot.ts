/**
 * Boot helper for plugin-contributed MCP tools (#2078).
 *
 * The Hono API server boots plugins in `packages/api/src/api/server.ts`
 * — registration, initialization, and `wireMcpToolPlugins` all happen
 * during process startup. The MCP server (`createAtlasMcpServer`) runs
 * in two configurations that need different boot logic:
 *
 *   - **stdio (separate process)**: spawned by Claude Desktop / Cursor
 *     via `bun packages/mcp/bin/serve.ts`. The plugin singleton starts
 *     empty; this helper registers + initializes plugins from
 *     `atlas.config.ts` so `mcpTools()` factories can run.
 *   - **SSE / hosted (same process as Hono)**: the plugin singleton is
 *     already populated by `server.ts`. This helper detects that via
 *     `plugins.isInitialized` and skips the re-init.
 *
 * Either way the MCP-tool registry is populated by `wireMcpToolPlugins`
 * before `createAtlasMcpServer` calls `registerPluginTools(server, ...)`.
 *
 * Failures (registration / initialization / wiring) are logged but do
 * not abort MCP server boot — operators expect the server to come up
 * even if a plugin is broken, so the broken plugin's tools are absent
 * from `tools/list` and the rest still work.
