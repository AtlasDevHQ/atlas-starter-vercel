/**
 * Pricing-page entitlement mirror — the pure mapping from the
 * `FeatureEntitlement` SSOT to the per-tier comparison rows the marketing
 * site renders (WS4 of #3984 / #3996).
 *
 * The marketing site (`@atlas/www`) is a standalone Next.js app with **no**
 * dependency on `@atlas/api` (the frontend must not import the API package —
 * CLAUDE.md), so the pricing comparison table cannot read
 * {@link FEATURE_ENTITLEMENTS} directly. Instead `scripts/generate-pricing-
 * entitlements.ts` mirrors this module's output into a plain data-only TS
 * artifact (`apps/www/src/app/pricing/entitlements.generated.ts`) that the
 * page imports, and `scripts/check-pricing-parity.sh` fails CI when the
 * artifact drifts from the SSOT.
 *
 * The mapping lives here — beside the SSOT, inside the test-runnable api
 * package — rather than in the root generator script so it is unit-testable
 * (the generator script merely renders + writes the file). Each cell is
 * computed with {@link isPlanEligible} against the feature's required tier:
 * the identical ordering the enforcement guard uses, so the page can never
 * claim a tier unlocks a feature the code gates above it.
