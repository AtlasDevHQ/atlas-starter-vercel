/**
 * Defensive strip for synthetic / backfilled connection-group names so the
 * raw ids don't leak into admin-facing copy.
 *
 * Why this lives in one place (closes #2432, originally tracked as #2426):
 * the same helper was duplicated across `chat/env-picker.tsx`,
 * `admin/connections/columns.tsx`, `admin/connections/page.tsx`, and
 * `admin/scheduled-tasks/task-form-dialog.tsx` — each carrying a slightly
 * different rule set (only the scheduled-tasks variant stripped the
 * `__global__:` prefix introduced by 0065/0068 and cleaned up by 0070).
 * Consolidating prevents a future migration from leaking through three of
 * four call sites by accident.
 *
 * Strips, in order:
 *   1. `__global__:` — synthetic display name from 0065/0068 cross-org
 *      mirroring (cleaned up by 0070, kept as a belt-and-suspenders strip).
 *   2. `g_` — the 0062 1:1-backfill id-as-name shape. `connection_groups.id`
 *      is `g_<connId>` and the row's `name` is the bare `<connId>`, so this
 *      strip only fires when an admin renames a group to a literal `g_*`
 *      value — defensive cleanup, not the common path.
 *
 * Returns the input unchanged when neither prefix matches.

/**
 * True when a connection-group id matches the migration 0062 1:1-backfill
 * shape AND the group's name still equals its source connection id (i.e.
 * the admin hasn't renamed it). Used by the admin Environments page to
 * collapse the "one auto-detected singleton per connection" noise behind a
 * toggle without hiding groups the admin has explicitly acted on.
 *
 * The id-prefix-only check (`startsWith("g_")`) is intentionally not enough:
 * the API also issues `g_<random>` ids for newly created groups, which we
 * must surface. The name equality clause is what disambiguates.

/**
 * True when a group is the empty residue of a merged-out backfill
 * singleton (#2506): id matches the `g_<connId>` backfill shape, name
 * still equals the bare connection id, and the group has zero
 * non-archived members. These survive when the merge wizard's cleanup
 * CTE was blocked by a content reference that later cleared, or when
 * a non-cascading member-move re-parented the connection out. See
 * migration 0072 for the full path enumeration.
 *
 * Migration 0072 sweeps existing rows; this helper hides any orphan that
 * survives until then from the env combobox (Add / Edit Connection
 * dialog) so the admin cannot accidentally re-anchor a new connection
 * to a ghost group whose label collides with a real connection id.
 *
 * Distinct from `isAutoBackfilledSingleton` (member-count 1) so the
 * Environments tab's "auto-detected singletons" toggle keeps its
 * literal meaning — empty orphans surface in the curated list with the
 * "No connections yet" affordance the admin can act on.
