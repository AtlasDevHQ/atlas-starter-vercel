/**
 * Returns the resolved deploy mode from the admin settings API.
 *
 * Fetches from `/api/v1/admin/settings` and extracts the `deployMode` field.
 * Falls back to a hostname-based guess while loading, on error, and when the
 * fetch is disabled (localhost and private-network hosts → "self-hosted";
 * public-internet hosts → "saas") so a slow fetch on `app.useatlas.dev`
 * doesn't briefly lie to the user that they're on a self-hosted deploy. The
 * guess is wrong for every custom-domain self-host (`atlas.company.com`),
 * so it is deliberately **not** a failure-path answer — `resolved` is `false`
 * on every guess path, and consumers commit to the mode by risk tier
 * (deploy-mode parity contract, Rule 2 in
 * docs/development/enterprise-gating.md, #3378):
 *
 * - **Cosmetic-only** branches (copy, icons) may render from the guess.
 * - **View-swapping** components (whole mode-specific views, redirects,
 *   mode-only nav items) render a neutral/loading state until
 *   `loading === false`, and must not commit to a guessed mode on `error`
 *   (use `resolved`, or surface the error).
 * - **Flows that write mode-specific values** must not save while `loading`
 *   is `true` or `error` is non-null — a guessed mode never decides what
 *   gets persisted.
 *
 * This hook does **not** resolve the regional API base. Under ADR-0024 the
 * region is known pre-auth (a signup selection or the `atlas_region` cookie,
 * see `@/lib/api-url`); the web client no longer reads `regionApiUrl` off the
 * US admin-settings response to discover its regional host (#3971). (The server
 * still returns that field for now — vestigial, pending a follow-up removal.)
